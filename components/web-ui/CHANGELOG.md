# Changelog for `web-ui`

Released as `web-ui/vX.Y.Z` git tags — see [Versioning and releases](../../docs/versioning-and-releases.md).

The Web UI has no outward contract of its own: nothing depends on it, and it depends on the HTTP API. So entries here describe what a *User* can see and do, not an interface anyone programs against.


## Unreleased


### Added

- **The toolchain.** Vite, React, TypeScript and MUI, built to a static bundle that nginx serves. No server-side rendering: the deployment is files behind a web server, and stays that way.
- **A landing page that link previews can read.** The title, description, canonical link, Open Graph and Twitter card tags and a `<noscript>` body are static in `index.html`, and `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are generated at build time from the same public-origin constant. Googlebot runs JavaScript and would have indexed the app regardless; the scrapers behind Slack, LinkedIn and Mastodon previews do not, and a URL that gets emailed around is the whole point of the public tier.
- **The theme** — printed paper: a warm ivory page, Source Serif 4 headings over Source Sans 3 body text, flat surfaces divided by hairline rules, and Charles University's cardinal red as the one saturated colour. Fonts are bundled rather than fetched from a CDN. Colour choices and their measured contrast ratios are recorded in `src/theme/palette.ts`.


- **A base path.** The app is built for `https://<host>/musibot/` rather than the root of a host, which every URL it emits has to account for. Asset and favicon URLs follow from Vite's `base`; the API's address is built from `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` in `src/api/base.ts`, and nothing in `src/` may write an absolute path — one works in every test and 404s in the deployment. The dev server serves under the same base, so it is not a production-only setting.


### Not yet implemented

Everything the UI is actually for. There is no upload, no pipeline picker, no progress view and no results view — `src/App.tsx` is a placeholder swatch that exists so the theme can be looked at. The API client layer is not written beyond knowing where the API is.
